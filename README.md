This parser is a module for a bigger app, which is control the circulation of confiscated, arrested and other property. The parser helps users to check and evaluate the actual price of the property. Users are offerred to use data from two most popular web-sites aka pin board for ads, both commercial and non-commercial: kufar.by and baraholka.onliner.by. Onliner is parsed by HTML-tags. Module starts working, when the search strings get the search word. Then web-site give all pages which is valid for search word and parser starts working. It checks all the pages in a loop with the neccesary HTML-tags and filters and then give results to the user. Kufar.by is a dynamic web-site, that's why it's parsed with api. Instead of HTML-tags, module finds the neccesary data by JSON which contain all the information about the ads on the page. At the end of the work user get product's name and price and the links to the ads.
